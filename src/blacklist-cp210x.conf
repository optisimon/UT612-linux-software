# How to apply this file:
# 1) Append the content of this file to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-cp210x.conf
# 2) run modprobe -a
# 3) either restart the computer, or manually run "rmmod cp210x" (which 
#    might give trouble if that module is in use)

# Needed to disable this to get the UT612 LCR meter working, since the
# cp210x kernel driver is eroneously trying to register that chip
# although that will NEVER be implemented in that driver (it should be a
# HID device).
#
# This alias is already removed in never kernel versions, but not yet in
# ubuntu (as of 14.04)
